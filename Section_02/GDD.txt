Problem:
- proving myself
- learning

concept, rulse:
- 'guess the isogram' game
- 'isogram' = word with no repeating letters
- limited number of guesses
- after each guess, game outputs BULL or COW
	bull = right letter in the right place
	cow = right letter in the wrong place
- win by guessing

requirements:
- what input? what format?		
- what outputs?
- what tasks?
- performance limits?
- what assets do I need?

- just text
- help player make the right guess
- checking number of cows and bulls in guessed word
- keeping track of number of valid guesses

possible in the future:
- feedback on every key press
- dictionary of words
- selectable difficulty, word length
- time limit?
- hints?
